# Tripedal Robot

This is a repo containing hardware, electrical and software components of a tripedal walker robot.

## Motivation

Ever since the early 2000s, people have been developing quadrupeds and bipeds such as robot dogs and humanoids. However, there is less effort directed towards tripedal robots. Although they lack the stability of quadrupedal robots and also may be more mechanically complex than bipedal robots, tripeds are interesting in two regards:
1. They are more techincally challenging than other widely studied robots. They can represent a robot dog with one missing leg.
2. They are more stable than bipeds while also being a bit cheaper than quadrupeds since they have fewer legs that need to be actuated.

## High level goals (WIP)

[] Take inspration from earlier work and minic similar designs
[] Develop feedforward walking algorithm through trial and error
[] Plan sensors and compute
[] Initially have everything on breadboards but slowly transition to PCB
[] Interate mechanically while developing feedback walking algorithms that accomendate a wider range of movements such as jumping, turning, walking on hills, and walking on rough/slippery terrain
